**Background** <br/>
A few global studies have shown secular increases in mean waist circumference (WC) relative to body mass index (BMI), especially in women. To update and expand on these research efforts, we used data from nationally-representative health examination surveys in the Americas (United States of America (US), Mexico, Chile, and Peru) and in England to quantify recent changes over time in BMI, WC, and WC relative to BMI, and explore differences by sex. 

Methods <br/>
Data from 1997 to 2020 among adults aged 25-64 years was analysed; US data was stratified by racial-ethnic groups. Means for BMI and WC, and prevalences of obesity and abdominal obesity, were compared between the first and last survey periods. Using data from all survey years, quantile regression models estimated secular change across the BMI and WC distributions. BMI was then added as a predictor to quantify secular change in WC relative to BMI, with predicted values estimated at overweight and obesity cut-points (25, 30 and 35kg/m2). Interaction terms were included in all models to evaluate differences in the magnitude of secular change by sex. 

Results <br/>
With the exception of Peru (no change in both sexes), means for BMI and WC increased between the first and last survey periods in each country / US racial-ethnic group in both sexes. Mean BMI increased more in women than in men in England (1997 vs. 2019: 0.9kg/m2 men; 1.6kg/m2 women). Mean WC increased more in women than in men in Chile (2003 vs. 2017: 4.1cm men; 6.0cm women), in US non-Hispanic (NH) whites (1999-2002 vs. 2015-18: 4.0cm men; 6.6cm women), and in England (1997 vs. 2019: 2.0cm men; 6.0cm women). 
BMI (except in men in Peru) and WC (except for both sexes in Peru) showed larger secular increases at the upper-tails of the distribution in both sexes. BMI and WC at the 50th and 75th centiles increased more in women than in men in England.

Mixed patterns were observed for the secular change in WC relative to BMI. Decreases over time in mean and median WC relative to BMI were observed in both sexes in Peru. In men, secular increases in WC relative to BMI were most evident in Mexico: mean WC monotonically increased with BMI; larger increases in WC at each BMI level were observed at the lower- and middle-centiles. 
Secular increases at the 50th and 75th WC centiles relative to BMI were most evident in women, with larger increases at higher levels of BMI especially in US NH whites and in England. At BMI = 25kg/m2, the increases in median WC ranged from 2.3cm in US Mexican-Americans (1999-2002 vs. 2015-18; 95% CI: 1.6-3.1) to 3.0cm in England (1997 vs. 2019; 95% CI: 2.4-3.5). At BMI = 30kg/m2, the increases in median WC ranged from 0.7cm in Mexico (2006 vs. 2018; 95% CI: 0.2-1.2) to 3.9cm in England (1997 vs. 2019; 95% CI: 3.0-4.8). 

Conclusions <br/>
Our analyses of anthropometric data, collected prior to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, support emerging evidence of increasing WC relative to BMI, especially in women. Disease risk, such as those associated with the amount of visceral fat, is potentially underestimated by surveillance efforts that quantify secular changes only in BMI.
