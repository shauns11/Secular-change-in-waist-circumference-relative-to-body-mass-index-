Background
A few global studies have shown secular increases in mean waist circumference relative to body mass index (BMI), especially in women. To update and expand on these research efforts, we used data from nationally-representative health examination surveys in the Americas (US, Mexico, Chile, and Peru) and in England to quantify recent changes over time in BMI, waist circumference, and waist circumference relative to BMI, and explore differences by sex. 

Methods
We analysed data among adults aged 25-64y from 1997 to 2020; US data was stratified by racial-ethnic groups. Means for BMI and waist circumference, and prevalences of obesity and abdominal obesity, were compared between the first and last survey periods. Quantile regression models estimated secular change across the BMI and waist circumference distributions. BMI was then subsequently added to the models to quantify secular change in waist circumference relative to BMI, with predicted values estimated at overweight and obesity cut-points (25, 30 and 35kg/m2). Relevant interaction terms were included in all models to evaluate heterogeneity by sex. 

Results
Means for BMI and waist circumference increased between the first and last survey periods in most countries in both sexes. Mean BMI increased more in women than in men in England (1997 vs. 2018: 0.7kg/m2 men; 1.3kg/m2 women); whilst mean waist circumference increased more in women than in men in Chile (2003 vs. 2017: 4.1cm men; 6.0cm women), in US non-Hispanic (NH) whites (1999-2002 vs. 2015-18: 4.0cm men; 6.6cm women), and in England (1997 vs. 2018: 1.7cm men; 5.5cm women).
BMI and waist circumference showed larger increases at the upper-tails of the distribution in each country and in both sexes. In contrast, increases over time in waist circumference at the middle- and upper-centiles at a given level of BMI were observed in women but not in men, with larger increases at higher levels of BMI in some countries and in certain US racial-ethnic groups. For example, at BMI = 25kg/m2, the significant increases in median waist circumference ranged in women from 2.1cm in Chile (2003 vs. 2017; 95% CI: 1.1-3.0) to 2.8cm in US NH whites (1999-2002 vs. 2015-18; 95% CI: 2.1-3.4). At BMI = 35kg/m2, the significant increases in median waist circumference ranged in women from 2.4cm in Chile (2003 vs. 2017; 95% CI: 0.9-3.8) to 4.0cm in England (1997 vs. 2018; 95% CI: 3.1-4.9).  

Conclusions
Our analyses of twenty years of anthropometric data support emerging evidence of increasing waist circumference relative to BMI, especially in women. Disease risk, such as those associated with the amount of visceral fat, is potentially underestimated by surveillance efforts that quantify secular changes only in BMI.
